# packHUF
A very basic compression tool for any file, based on Huffman coding. This is mainly intended as educational code or base for bigger projects.

packHUF really is more some kind of an experiment than actually useful (for the typical user) software. It is a pure huffman based compression tool and therefore will typically achieve rather poor results when compared with more recent developments. It may still be a great base for further developments.

packHUF is based on the huffman routines in packMP3 but, on it’s own, has almost not been tested at all – so stuff might go wrong for you, you’ve been warned.

You may freely use packHUF under the terms of the LGPL.
